Benefits:

 * happy music loving citizens that can turn up the music if nobody is negatively affected
 * happy neighbours that can enjoy a quiet environment when they want to
 * useful data (currently it is hard to predict when you are able to turn up the music without affecting your neighbours in a negative way)

possible extensions:
 - equalizer access (bass travels further)
 - authorization by tapping the beat you hear ;-)
 - authorization by automatically recognizing the beat you hear
