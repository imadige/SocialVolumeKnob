The idea is that you give people surrounding you a possibility to control the loudness of your music.

This could bring us the following benefits:

 * happy music loving citizens that can turn up the music if nobody is negatively affected
 * happy neighbours that can enjoy silence when they want it
 * interesting data (currently it is hard to predict how often you are able to turn up the music without affecting others in a negative way)

possible extensions:
 - equalizer access (bass travels longer)
 - authorization by tapping the beat you hear ;-)
